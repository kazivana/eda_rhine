#4: The catchment area refers to the area where rainwater is collected by the river. 
# At higher altitudes such as the beginning of the Rhine at the Alps, the river has
# only just begun, meaning there is not a lot of catchment area. In contrast, by the
# time it reaches the ocean and the elevation is minimal/nonexistent, the entire
# river is behind this point, meaning the catchment area is very large here where 
# the entirety of the river converges with the open water.
